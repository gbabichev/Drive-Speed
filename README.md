A lightweight macOS application for testing disk read and write speeds across different file sizes.

## Features

- **Multi-Size Testing**: Run speed tests with three different file sizes:
  - 100 MB test - Quick baseline measurement
  - 1 GB test - Standard throughput measurement
  - 10 GB test - Large file performance test

- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Each test measures both read and write speeds in MB/s

- **Disk Selection**: Choose from any mounted drive on your system with real-time space availability display

- **Automatic Validation**: Checks for sufficient disk space before running tests (requires 11GB available)

## Usage

1. **Launch the app** - Open Drive Speed from your Applications folder

2. **Select a Drive** - Use the dropdown in the toolbar to choose which drive to test

3. **Check Available Space** - The app displays available disk space; you need at least 11GB to run the full test suite

4. **Start Testing** - Click the "Start Speed Test" button in the toolbar

5. **Wait for Results** - The app will:
   - Test write speed (100MB, 1GB, 10GB files)
   - Test read speed for each file
   - Display results when complete

6. **View Results** - Results appear in the scrollable area below, showing read/write speeds for each test size

## How It Works

### Write Test
- Creates a test file in chunks (8MB at a time)
- Measures sequential write performance
- Synchronizes to disk after completion

### Read Test
- Reads the test file sequentially in chunks (8MB at a time)
- Measures sustained read performance
- Single pass for efficiency

### Why Three File Sizes?
Different file sizes reveal different performance characteristics:
- **100 MB**: Quick test, useful for cached/buffered performance
- **1 GB**: Standard measurement, balances speed vs. test duration
- **10 GB**: Reveals sustained performance without heavy caching

## üñ•Ô∏è Install & Minimum Requirements

- macOS 14.0 or later  
- Apple Silicon & Intel (Not tested on Intel)
- ~10 MB free disk space
